Geometric Shapes Project
program by: Or-Ram Atar and Romi Sinizkey

This project loading a game in which the player need to escape from the gaurds throw the door.
each of the guards have different level of hardness and the tools that the player have to avoid them 
or deal with them, is putting a bomb to destroy the guards and other obstacles.


the following files were already provided to us and were untouched: txt.CMakeLists, main.cpp,io.cpp, io.h, Location.h.
***note: we have added.

files that were added are: Bomb.h, Bomb.cpp, Guard.h, Guard.cpp, Gamemanager.h, Gamemanager.cpp, Board.h, Board.cpp, robot.h, robot.cpp.

In Bomb.h, robot.h, Guard.h, Gamemanager.h, Board.h   we wrote the template of the class along with constructors, functions, and members;
Gamemanager - loading the game, giving  stats for the player like  life and score, calling for other function  to 
generate the game.
Board - generate the map, have all the information about the map, where the player, guards , bomb, size and more.
Guard - in charge of moving the guards and giving them the level of hardness.
Bomb - generate bombs based on how much the player pressed b. the bomb destroying what  what is located near it.
Bobot - storing the score and the function for moving the player. 

In Bomb.cpp, Gamemaneger.cpp, Guard.cpp, Robot.cpp and Board.cpp  we have implemented the constructors, the specific functions for this class, and the functions that are in every class
